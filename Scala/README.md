# Scala
Scala is a language built on top, and very related to, Java.
It provided a lot of the functional programming that Java lacked
at the time. While Java has made significant progress in becoming more
functional it still hasn't (and probably never will) reach the level of
Scala. Unfortunately, Scala lacks a degree of readibility that some other
programming languages.

Because Scala has taken a different approach than the core Java it is built upon,
the ability to utilize core Java libraries within Scala code is clumsy at best. This can
lead to lower performance in some cases.

## How to Compile
Unless noted otherwise, Scala code can be compiled using the `scalac` command. More advanced projects
may take advantage and utilize the `sbt` package and build management.

## How to Run the Code
Scala code can be executed utilizing the `scala` command for projects.
