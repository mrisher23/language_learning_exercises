# Rust
Rust is a modern challenger to C++ as the king of powerful and efficient programming languages. C++ is about 40 years old, and while it has seen updates every few years, it is saddled with it's older design. Rust seeks to take the advantages of C++ and integrate modern programming features such as type and memory safety. Rust also provides a more modern take on external package management.
