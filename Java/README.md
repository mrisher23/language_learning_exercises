# Java
Java, maintained by Oracle, has been a standard of the development community since 1996. It is a partially compiled language which requires a Java engine to run the application. The language was originally developed by SUN Microsystems until it released Java 1.5. Oracle took over development of the language but after version 1.8, they did some questionable things with the licensing of the language. This was removed around Java 11.

The release schedule of Java versions has drastically increased from ~2 years per version to about 6 months. You will commonly see projects still using Java 8 though the latest version at this time is Java 19. Some developers have taken issue with Oracle's licensing and prefer to use the open source version called OpenJDK.

In order to do Java development, you'll need to download a Java JDK (Java Development Kit) or also referred to as SDK (Software Development Kit). This will allow you to compile Java code. Oracle offers a different download which only allows you to run compiled code, so be careful which one you download.
