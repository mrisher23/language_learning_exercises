# Bash
BASH stands for Bourne Again Shell which is one of the common terminal shells utilized in *nix operating systems. Different Operating Systems have slightly different implementations. The goal is to attempt to utilize the most standardized language features available.

## Compiling the Code
Shell scripts do not need to be compiled. However, they do need to have the execute flag set (+x) 
on their file permissions.

## Running the Code
Shell scripts can be run by simply typing `./scriptname.sh` into the console.
