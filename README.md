# Language Learning Exercises
Repository of development projects which demonstrate various mini solutions to problems in various 
languages that demonstrate how the language is utilized.

**Always review the code you are running before executing it. These examples are intended for 
learning purposes, but you are running other people's code on your machine which may do harmful 
things. We try to review all code before it is accepted but cannot ensure its safety every time**

This project is not open for public submission just yet. Once the objectives of each exercise are 
more clearly defined and ordered it will be opened up for public contribution. There will be strict 
commenting and compilation requirements so others may learn from the submitted examples.

For any particular problem there are going to be a large number of possible solutions. The goal is to demonstrate core language features and best practices. For some projects where there are multiple, equally valid solutions which cannot exist within the same project the folders should be named:

1a Project Name
1b Project Name
1c Project Name


The following objectives should be addressed where it is applicable to the language being demonstrated.
Comments should be included which clearly show how the objective works. Include instructions
on how to compile/run the example.

1. Hello World
> Create a program that prints "Hello World" to standard output.

2. Comments
> Create a runnable program that contains examples of different types of comments.

3. Variables
> Create a runnable program that initializes variables of all the built-in data types.

4. Mathematical Operations
> Create a runnable program that initializes several numerical variables and performs
> various mathematical operations on them showing the results.

5. Conditionals
> Create a runnable program that has multiple execution paths based on simple or complex
> conditions. Show if, if/else, nested ifs, and switch statements as possible.

6. Type Conversion
> Create a runnable program and initializes variables of all the built-in types and converts
> them to any of the other built-in types as possible.

7. Arrays
> Create a runnable program that initializes several arrays of different types and sizes.
> Demonstrate setting/getting the values of different elements.

8. Loops
> Create a runnable program that demonstrates the different looping mechanisms of the language.

9. Functions
> Create a runnable program that demonstrates executing functions. Show passing of parameters
> and providing return values.

10. Recursion
> Create a runnable program that demonstrates executing a recursive function and how parameters
> are managed between invocations.

11. Command-line Arguments
> Create a runnable program that accepts arguments from the command-line invocation. Do
> not rely on external libraries to implement (does not need to be robust, error tolerant)

12. Environment Variables
> Create a runnable program that accesses environment variables (e.g. $PATH) or built-in 
> globals. Demonstrate the ability to create global variables within your own programs.

13. Project Organization
> Create a runnable program that shows how a project should be organized to accommodate
> more complex project structure.

14. Import Libraries
> Create a runnable program that pulls in code from an external provider. Show how to get
> the code, where it comes from, and how to invoke it.

15. Automated Documentation
> Create compilable codebase that contains automated documentation output for it.

16. Logging
> Create a runnable program that produces logging output instead of print statements.

17. Exceptions
> Create a runnable program that creates an exception and then handles the error.

18. Files
> Create a runnable program that demonstrates how to read and write a file.

19. Command-line Arguments v2
> Create a runnable program that accepts command-line arguments that uses flags and
> validates required parameters and argument types. May use external library to facilitate
> the advanced parsing.

20. Random
> Create a runnable program that can generate random numbers from 0-1; from 0...N; non-normal
> distribution (if available)

21. Time
> Create a runnable program that gets the current timestamp; does math to compare, add, subtract
> times.

22. Interactive STDIN/OUT
> Create a runnable program that prompts for and receives input from STDIN.

23. Formatted Output
> Create a runnable program that prints formatted output for dates, numbers and padding for 
> strings.

24. String Manipulation
> Create a runnable program that shows how to search a string, match against regex
> patterns, create substrings

25. Structured File Parsing
> Create a runnable program that can parse YAML, JSON, XML and properties file types.

26. Sorting
> Create a runnable program that performs a simple sort (manually) on a list of items.

27. Sorting v2
> Create a runnable program which uses a larger list of elements and built-in or external
> library to sort the elements.

28. Simple Object
> Create a simple object type that contains a few properties (variables) and several
> functions.

29. Enumeration
> Create an enumeration type.

30. Advanced Objects
> Create an object that has more advanced functionality

31. Packaging
> Create a project that can be packaged and distributed to a third party.

32. Object to String
> Create a project that demonstrates how an object can be converted to a string for
> printing or logging.

33. Sorting Custom Objects
> Create a runnable program that uses a custom object type and sorts it within a list
> type.

34. Serializing Objects
> Create a program that serializes a custom object type to one or more external
> formats: Binary, String, JSON, XML, etc.

35. Inheritance
36. Inheritance v2
37. Automated Testing
> Create a project that uses automated testing to validate the functionality of the
> program. Attempt to include unit and integration tests where mocking of external
> resources is used.

38. Resource Files
> Create a runnable program that is capable of accessing files that are included within
> its packaging.

39. Threading
> Create a runnable project that uses multiple threads which demonstrate how to start
> a thread, block on critical code sections, detect when threads are completed.
