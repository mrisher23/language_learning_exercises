# Language Learning Exercises
Repository of development projects which demonstrate various mini solutions to problems in various 
languages that demonstrate how the language is utilized.

**Always review the code you are running before executing it. These examples are intended for 
learning purposes, but you are running other people's code on your machine which may do harmful 
things. We try to review all code before it is accepted but cannot ensure its safety every time**

This project is not open for public submission just yet. Once the objectives of each exercise are 
more clearly defined and ordered it will be opened up for public contribution. There will be strict 
commenting and compilation requirements so others may learn from the submitted examples.

For any particular problem there are going to be a large number of possible solutions. The goal is to demonstrate core language features and best practices. For some projects where there are multiple, equally valid solutions which cannot exist within the same project the folders should be named:

1a Project Name
1b Project Name
1c Project Name
