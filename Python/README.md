# Python
Python is an interpreted scripting language which is powerful yet has a low bar for entry so is 
popular with people without a development background. Significant improvements have been made in 
recent versions to make the language much more efficient.

Python 2 has been nearly impossible to kill, but it is far past the expiration of support. 
Unfortunately, many operating systems still have python2 installed and set as the default 
implementation. While Python 3.11 is the current version, no project here should require a version 
below Python 3.5.

## Compiling the Code
Python is an interpreted language and does not need to be compiled beforehand. If a project needs 
to be packaged, the project should contain instructions for doing so. 

## Running the Code
Since the command `python` is typically reserved for Python 2.x, most installations use `python3` or 
something representing the specific version being used (e.g. `python3.9`). Each project should
state if a specific version of Python is required.
