## Perl
Perl is an interpreted language which can be very powerful and is often
utilized in web administration and networking. It makes a good beginner
programming utility but may be slightly more difficult to learn than some
other languages and is not as performant.

Many computers already have a Perl interpreter built-in, but if you find that
you need one, you can find the interpreter at https://www.perl.org
