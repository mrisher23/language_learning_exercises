# C++
C++ is a staple of modern software development. It is powerful and dangerous for those that don't know all of the possible pitfalls. The language is compiled and object oriented.

The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is a popular source for obtaining a compiler, but many are available.

## Compiling the Code
C++ code can be compiled using a large variety of tools. GCC is the preferred platform for simplicity.
However, using `make` for advanced projects is desirable for demonstration.

## Running the Code
After compilation, code should be runnable by double clicking the output file or executing it from a terminal.
